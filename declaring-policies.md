Title: Declaring Fairness, Energy, and Security Policies in Fabric

🎯 Objective
Define and embed compliance policies into Fabric agent metadata to ensure enforceability and audit readiness.

📄 1. What is a Compliance Policy?
A Fabric policy is a structured YAML file that outlines non-functional guarantees, such as:

✅ Fairness: e.g., demographic parity, bias mitigation

⚡ Energy Efficiency: model FLOPs, device power envelope

🔐 Security: runtime guarantees, data encryption

These policies are signed, validated, and enforced at runtime.

📘 2. YAML Policy Example
yaml
Copy
Edit
version: 1.0
agent: agent-repacker
compliance:
  fairness:
    objective: demographic_parity
    threshold: 0.1
  energy:
    max_power_watts: 12
    measurement_unit: avg_over_60s
  security:
    runtime: enclave
    encrypted_io: true
    sandbox: true
jurisdictions:
  - GDPR
  - HIPAA
author: ai-compliance@fabric.ai
📌 3. File Naming and Placement
Place this YAML at:

bash
Copy
Edit
models/agent-repacker/1.0.0/data/compliance_policy.yaml
Link it in model.yaml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
compliance_policy: data/compliance_policy.yaml
🔧 4. Validate the Policy
bash
Copy
Edit
fab model validate models/agent-repacker/1.0.0/model.yaml
🔐 5. Why It Matters
Enables policy-aware scheduling across agents.

Prevents non-compliant deployment.

Supports automated audits by third parties.

🧠 Tips
Use fab policy lint (coming soon) to check schema correctness.

Reference jurisdiction profiles in compliance/ directory (e.g., HIPAA.profile).
