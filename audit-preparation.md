Title: Preparing Fabric Agents for Compliance Audits

🎯 Goal
Prepare all artifacts, metadata, and proof chains to support formal regulatory audits (e.g., GDPR Article 30, HIPAA Security Rule, CCPA disclosures).

🛠️ 1. Agent Declaration Checklist
Ensure your model.yaml includes:

yaml
Copy
Edit
compliance:
  policies: [GDPR, HIPAA]
  data_controls:
    consent_required: true
    deletion_supported: true
  audit_ready: true
🔐 2. Provenance Signatures
Each Fabric block and artifact must be signed:

bash
Copy
Edit
fab model sign models/agent-repacker/1.0.0/model.yaml --key my-signing-key.asc
Verifiable by:

bash
Copy
Edit
fab model verify --provenance
📂 3. Prepare Audit Bundle
Generate an audit-ready archive:

bash
Copy
Edit
fab model audit-bundle agent-repacker --version 1.0.0 --output audit_bundle.zip
Includes:

Signed model.yaml

Execution lineage trace

Policy declarations

Usage logs

Data control metadata

📝 4. Audit Ledger Snapshot
Store immutable state to the provenance ledger:

bash
Copy
Edit
fab ledger snapshot agent-repacker@1.0.0
Confirms all compliance state as of deployment.

🧪 5. Validate Audit Readiness
Dry-run audit check:

bash
Copy
Edit
fab audit check agent-repacker@1.0.0 --jurisdiction GDPR
Reports:

Missing logs

Missing declarations

Signature mismatches

✅ Done
You can now deliver:

Machine-verifiable compliance metadata

Immutable ledger snapshot

Proof of fairness, consent, and controls

🔁 Run audit-bundle and snapshot before each major release.
