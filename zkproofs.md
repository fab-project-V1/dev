# 🔏 Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in Fabric

Fabric integrates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to ensure **verifiable compliance, correctness, and provenance**—without revealing underlying data or model internals.

---

## 🧠 Why ZKPs?

ZKPs allow Fabric to:

- ✅ Prove a model made a decision based on policy-compliant data
- 🔒 Avoid leaking sensitive features or model logic
- 🧾 Generate attestable evidence of lawful execution

## 🧮 ZKP Applications in Fabric

| Area                     | ZKP Role |
|--------------------------|----------|
| 👤 Identity validation    | Prove access rights without revealing user identity |
| 📈 Model behavior audits | Prove the model used only allowed weights/data |
| 🧠 Fairness verification  | Prove compliance with fairness policy weights |
| 🔐 Enclave correctness    | Prove enclave executed the right code blob |
| 📦 Packaging integrity    | Validate no tampering post-certification |

## 🔧 ZKP Circuits in Fabric

Each `.fab` model can define a ZK circuit:

```yaml
compliance:
  zkproof:
    circuit: fairness.circom
    inputs:
      - weights.json
      - dataset_digest
Fabric supports:

Circom 2.0

R1CS (Bellman, Arkworks)

STARK-compatible outputs (via Cairo/ZKSync)

🧪 Proving and Verifying
🏗 Circuit compiled

📤 Witness generated from runtime inputs

🔁 ZKP produced and embedded into execution record

✅ Verified by any ledger peer or compliance tool

Example:

bash

fab zk compile fairness.circom
fab zk prove --inputs inputs.json --output proof.zkp
fab zk verify --proof proof.zkp --circuit fairness.json
🧾 Compliance Enforcement with ZKPs
Proofs are automatically included in:

execution.manifest.json

ledger.commit.log

Agent runtime attestations

ZKP-backed compliance is non-optional for certified models.

🚀 Upcoming Features
🧬 ZK-ML compatibility for large models

📜 DSL-native ZKP circuit embedding

⚖️ On-chain arbitration via ZKP challenge-response
