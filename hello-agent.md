Hello, Agent!
Welcome to your first Fabric agent. This tutorial walks you through creating a minimal .fab module and executing it locally using the Fabric CLI.

üß† What You‚Äôll Learn
Basic structure of a Fabric agent.

Writing your first .fab file.

Running the agent in a local test environment.

üß∞ Prerequisites
Fabric CLI installed (pip install fab-cli)

Docker (for local sandbox runtime)

A working directory (e.g., ~/fabric-lab)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Your Project
bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir hello-agent
cd hello-agent
fab init
This scaffolds a basic project.fab file.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Define a Minimal Agent
Replace the contents of project.fab with:

fab
Copy
Edit
agent HelloAgent {
  input: string
  output: string

  run {
    return "Hello, " + input + "!"
  }
}
This defines a stateless agent that appends your input to "Hello, ".

3Ô∏è‚É£ Compile the Agent
bash
Copy
Edit
fab build
You should see ‚úî Build succeeded.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Agent
You can now test the agent locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
fab run HelloAgent --input '"World"'
Expected output:

json
Copy
Edit
"Hello, World!"
‚úÖ What‚Äôs Next?
Try editing the run block to:

fab
Copy
Edit
return input.uppercase()
Then rebuild and rerun to see the difference.

üß© Summary
You‚Äôve created a basic agent using the Fabric DSL, compiled it, and tested it interactively. This is your first step toward building complex multimodal systems in Fabric.
