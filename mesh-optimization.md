# 🌐 Mesh Optimization in Fabric

Fabric supports deployment across heterogeneous execution meshes—clusters of nodes with varying compute, memory, and latency profiles. Mesh optimization ensures models and agents are optimally distributed to meet SLAs, reduce cost, and increase resiliency.

## 🧱 What Is a Mesh?

A Fabric mesh consists of:

- **Agent-VM nodes**: Runtime enclaves for executing `.fab` agents
- **Specialized nodes**: e.g., GPU, TPU, quantum, vision ASICs
- **Topology-aware scheduler**: Places execution for latency and energy goals

---

## 🎯 Optimization Goals

- ⏱ **Minimize latency** via node proximity and cold-start reduction
- 🔋 **Optimize energy** per SLA/usage patterns
- 💵 **Control cost** by dynamically shifting workloads
- 🧩 **Ensure compatibility** with model requirements

---

## 🛠 Enabling Mesh-Aware Optimization

In `model.yaml`, define mesh targets:

```yaml
deployment:
  targets:
    - class: edge
      location: NA-West
      constraints:
        - gpu: true
        - ram_gb: >=4
    - class: cloud
      provider: AWS
      region: us-west-2
Then use:

bash

fab deploy --mesh-optimize
This auto-routes the model using the UDAP scheduler.

📊 Cost-Latency Tradeoff Modes
Mode	Description
latency-first	Favor response time, use GPUs
energy-first	Target lowest Joules/inference
balanced	Tradeoff energy, cost, and speed

Set via:

bash

fab config set mesh.mode latency-first
🔄 Dynamic Rebinding
Fabric automatically:

Migrates agents if latency spikes

Re-routes during outages

A/B tests performance variants

Enable rebalancing:

yaml

policy:
  mesh_autobalance: true
🔍 Diagnostics
Use:

bash

fab monitor mesh agent-repacker
To visualize deployment efficiency, node load, and fallbacks.

Mesh optimization unlocks true scale, fault tolerance, and precision placement for your intelligent workloads—no overprovisioning required.
