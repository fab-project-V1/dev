# 🕵️‍♀️ Data Anonymization in Fabric

To meet global privacy standards (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA), Fabric enforces robust **data anonymization** mechanisms across the model lifecycle.

## 🔐 Anonymization in the Model Pipeline

| Stage               | What’s Anonymized            | How                        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 📥 Ingestion         | PII, location, identity        | Hashing, masking, redaction |
| 🧠 Training          | Sensitive features             | Differential privacy        |
| 🔍 Evaluation        | Sample traces, logs            | Synthetic sampling          |
| 🚀 Inference         | Client payloads                | Token-level redaction       |
| 📝 Ledger Recording  | Input/output hashes            | Encrypted provenance keys   |

## 🧾 Supported Techniques

- 🔒 **Token Scrubbing**  
  Mask or drop sensitive tokens pre-model inference

- 📈 **Differential Privacy**  
  Add statistical noise during training/eval to preserve utility while protecting identity

- 🌀 **Synthetic Data Replacement**  
  Replace raw records with statistically similar samples

- 🔄 **One-Way Hashing**  
  SHA-256 and BLAKE3 digests for non-reversible user identity encoding

- 🧬 **Homomorphic Encryption (Future)**  
  Enable computation on encrypted data

## ⚙️ DSL Controls

Fabric `.fab` modules can define anonymization constraints:

```yaml
agent:
  privacy:
    level: strict
    methods:
      - token_scrubbing
      - diff_privacy
    redaction:
      patterns:
        - "Name: .*"
        - "SSN: \d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}"
✅ Compliance Backed by Policy Engine
Anonymization is enforced in:

fab-runtime via policy kernel hooks

fab-ledger before provenance commitment

fab-audit for certified model inspection

Models failing anonymization audits are automatically decertified.

🧪 Testing Anonymization
bash

fab test privacy --module MyModule.fab
fab audit --privacy-checks
Results detail potential leak vectors and anonymization success rate.

Data anonymization in Fabric ensures AI compliance without compromising utility.
