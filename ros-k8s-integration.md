# ROS & Kubernetes Integration with Fabric

Fabric seamlessly interoperates with robotics systems using ROS and deploys scalable AI services using Kubernetes. This makes it ideal for deploying intelligent agents in physical systems and autonomous environments.

---

## ü§ñ ROS (Robot Operating System) Integration

### Use Cases

- Robotic perception with Fabric vision models
- Language understanding for voice-controlled agents
- Decision modules using Fabric policies

### ROS Bridge Agent

You can create a `.fab` module that listens to ROS topics and publishes Fabric outputs.

```fab
agent ROSVisionBridge {
  input: {
    camera_image: Image
  }
  output: {
    labeled_objects: List<Label>
  }
  implementation: "ros_bridge.py"
}
In ros_bridge.py, use rospy to bridge ROS and Fabric:

python

import rospy
from sensor_msgs.msg import Image
from fabric_sdk import call_agent

def callback(msg):
    result = call_agent("edge-vision-v2", image=msg.data)
    # Publish results to ROS
Launch with ROS
bash

roslaunch ros_fabric_bridge bridge.launch
‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Integration
Fabric agents and models are deployable as containerized services in Kubernetes clusters.

Helm Charts
Each Fabric app includes a Helm chart under config/helm-chart/. Customize values:

yaml

replicaCount: 3
image:
  repository: fabric/agent-vm
  tag: 1.0.0
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 1
    memory: 512Mi
Install with:

bash

helm install fabric-app ./config/helm-chart
Fabric CRDs
Fabric supports Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for declarative deployments.

yaml

apiVersion: fabric.ai/v1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: edge-vision-v2
spec:
  modelRef: edge-vision-v2@1.0.0
  replicas: 2
Apply:

bash

kubectl apply -f agent.yaml
üöÄ Hybrid Robotics + Cloud Inference
Combine ROS on edge with Fabric in the cloud:

Edge: ROS agents with lightweight perception

Cloud: Fabric for advanced NLP or multimodal inference

Communication: gRPC or HTTP with Fabric APIs
