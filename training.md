# 🎓 Model Training with Fabric

This guide explains how to train a model from scratch or fine-tune an existing one using Fabric’s standardized tooling and dataset architecture.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Before training:

- Fabric model scaffold initialized (`fab init`)
- Training dataset prepared (`.jsonl`, `.parquet`, or `.tsv`)
- Model defined in `.fab` DSL or loaded from a hub
- Training configuration YAML ready

---

## 🏗️ Directory Layout

A typical training directory:

models/
└── my-model/
└── 1.0.0/
├── training/
│ ├── config.yaml
│ ├── train.py
│ └── output/
└── data/
└── training_data.jsonl



---

## 📄 Training Config (YAML)

```yaml
model: pythia-70m
epochs: 3
batch_size: 32
learning_rate: 5e-5
optimizer: adamw
scheduler: linear
loss: cross_entropy
logging: wandb
save_every: 100
🏃 Run Training
From the model root:

bash

fab train --config training/config.yaml
This compiles the .fab module, loads the data, initializes the tokenizer and model, and trains with standard checkpoints.

Output includes:

output/model.safetensors

output/tokenizer.json

output/config.json

Checkpoint folders (checkpoint-100, checkpoint-200, ...)

🧠 Supported Frameworks
Fabric integrates with:

🤗 Transformers (PyTorch, Accelerate)

TensorFlow 2.x

ONNX Runtime

Lightning / Megatron

Choose backend in config or via --framework flag.

🔍 Monitoring
Training logs include:

Loss, accuracy

Learning rate schedule

Checkpoint and save status

Use wandb, tensorboard, or Fabric’s internal UI:

bash

fab monitor train --live
🔐 Compliance & Provenance
Fabric logs:

Training hash (data, config, commit)

Environment metadata

Energy usage (if measured)

Fairness weights (if specified)

Enable with:

bash

fab train --certify
