# 🏛️ Governance Architecture in Fabric

Fabric integrates a programmable and enforceable governance model that applies from DSL compilation to distributed deployment. It enables transparent decision-making, upgrade pathways, and stakeholder alignment.

---

## 📚 Governance Components

### 1. **RFC Process**
- Proposals for language features, system changes, or policy updates
- Stored in `language-spec/rfcs/`
- Each RFC includes rationale, compatibility notes, and transition plans

```bash
fab rfc new "RFC-0023-agent-sandboxing"
fab rfc review 0023
2. Versioning & Evolution
Semantic versioning enforced (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

Cross-version compatibility checked during:

bash

fab check --compat
Models and modules pinned by version:

yaml

model: agent-repacker@1.0.0
3. Governance Agents
Trusted agents embedded in mesh deployments

Apply policies like:

Rate limits

Fork approval workflows

Rejection of non-certified models

🔐 Policy Kernel
The policy kernel executes:

Fairness rules

Energy constraints

Privacy compliance

Usage quotas

Defined in:

yaml

policy:
  fairness:
    user: 0.6
    system: 0.4
  energy_budget: 50J/call
🗳️ Proposal Lifecycle
Draft RFC and link test cases

Stakeholder vote via governance ledger

Automated merge or rejection

Propagation to fab-cli, VSCode, and compiler backends

📈 Auditable Governance
All governance changes are:

Tracked on-chain (Merkle ledger)

Traceable via fab audit

Exportable to CSV or JSONL

bash

fab audit --rfc RFC-0017
🤝 Open Participation
Fabric governance is decentralized:

Contributors propose changes

Reviewers assess compatibility

Infra maintainers enforce rules

Transparent. Reproducible. Auditable.

Governance isn't a bottleneck—it's a security and trust accelerator in Fabric.
